# serverless localhost [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/softprops/serverless-localhost.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/softprops/serverless-localhost)

> npx serverless localhost

## Overview

Goals

* 👩‍💻 Shorten AWS Lambda development feedback loops
* ⚡ Integrate with your existing serverless application
* ⛱️ Work with **all** AWS Lambda runtimes, out of the box
* 🐑 Leverage [lambci project](https://github.com/lambci/) for undifferentiated heaving lifting

## 📦 Install

> 💡 This plugin relies on Docker to emulate AWS Lambda runtimes. If you don't have that
installed you can learn how to [here](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

Inside a serverless project directory run the following

```sh
$ npm install -D softprops/serverless-local
```

Add the `serverless-localhost` to your `serverless.yml` file's
list of `plugins`

```yaml
service: demo
provider:
  name: aws
  runtime: xxx
plugins:
  - serverless-localhost
functions:
  test:
    handler: foo.bar
    events:
      - http:
          path: /
          method: GET
```

## 🤸 Usage

Run the following in your terminal

```sh
$ npx serverless localhost
```

### 🌏 Environment variables
Environment variables defined in your `serverless.yml` will be made available inside
the localhost server. If your `serverless.yml` is configured to source their
values from the deployment env, i.e. `${env.FOO,''}` just export their values
before starting the server.

```sh
$ FOO=bar npx serverless localhost
```

## 🔬 Debugging

If you find your having a problem with this plugin, you can run this plugin's command
with the `DEBUG` environment variable set to "localhost"

```sh
$ DEBUG=localhost npx serverless localhost
```
